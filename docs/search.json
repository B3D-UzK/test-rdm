These policies establish guidelines and practices that govern various aspects of data handling, including collection, storage, access, and dissemination. They play a crucial role in promoting transparency, collaboration, and the advancement of scientific research in the field of astrophysics.\nThe formulation of these policies is based on a comprehensive evaluation of existing German research data (RD) policies, a comparison with international recommendations for RD policy development, as well as expert interviews conducted with German universities and a technical college. This process has allowed for the subdivision of key questions and text modules according to the RD policy scheme.\nThe key questions posed during the policy development process draw insights from the evaluation of German RD policies, ensuring alignment with best practices. Additionally, international recommendations for RD policy creation have been taken into account to ensure the policies are robust and globally relevant. Expert interviews with German experts from universities have provided valuable input and perspectives.\nBy incorporating these key questions and text modules into the data policies, the astrophysics community can establish a comprehensive and effective framework for managing research data.

How will the data be collected or created? What metadata documentation will accompany the data? How will you manage ethical and legal issues related to data ownership, privacy, and copyright? How will you store and backup the data? How will you manage access and security? Which data should be retained, shared, and/or preserved? What is the long-term preservation plan for the dataset? How will you share the data? Who will be responsible for data management? What resources will you require to implement your plan?\nThe DMP should justify the data format choice and include storage implications due to the format or volume of the data.\nThe DMP should describe the data collection methods, organizing data files, applying version control, and implementing quality assurance protocols.\nThe DMP should identify provisions for protecting the confidentiality of human participants if the project involves research with human subjects.\nThe DMP should identify the owner of the data and discuss permissions with the data producer if third-party data is being reused.\nThe DMP should include provisions for systematic backups of the data files and describe security measures in detail.\nThe DMP should identify the repository to be used to archive the data and plans to prepare and document the data for long-term preservation.\nThe DMP should identify the mechanism for sharing the data and any restrictions required for data sharing.\nThe DMP should identify who will oversee the implementation of the data management plan and what resources will be required for data management tasks and long-term preservation."

It may be necessary to consult with the responsible department or legal department to ensure that the regulations\ngoverning the ownership of rights are properly understood and followed. In addition, the\nregulations for researchers without an employment contract should also be considered.\nLegal regulations, such as the freedom of science guaranteed in the Basic Law, must also\nbe taken into account when determining the ownership of rights in research collaborations.\n\nThe ownership of rights is determined by the employment contract or specific association.

They should also determine the possible costs surrounding data management and identify appropriate data repositories.\nDuring the data collection phase, researchers should follow data management best practices, including file organization, backup and storage strategies, and quality assurance protocols. They should also consider access controls and data security.\nDuring the preparation and data analysis phase, researchers may need to clean, manipulate or process the raw data, and should document any changes to the raw data and create a master version to be analyzed and eventually archived. They should also document analysis procedures, such as modifications to the data, the model used, the code used to run the analysis, and hardware and software specifications.\nDuring the publication and sharing phase, researchers should prepare their data files and other research materials necessary to interpret and reuse the data in the future. They should consult with information professionals or data repository staff and ensure that their data management meets all of the needs and requirements of the repository.\nTrusted repositories perform functions to ensure the long-term management of data, including ensuring the integrity of the data, protecting against data loss, and providing access to data."
